# Program for simple manipulation of vectors

## Why Does this program exist?
I wrote this program to apply knowledge I learnt from the classic book `Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs`, 
written by Abelson and Sussman; specifically, I applied the concept of `data abstraction`.

## Developed with
- Emacs; and 
- MIT-Scheme.

## Thanks
A thanks to the `SICP` authors for writing a remarkable book.
